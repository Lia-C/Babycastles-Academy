# Babycastles Academy Manual

*Note: The Babycastles Academy Manual is a working document. Please let us know if anything could be improved or made clearer or if you have any other suggestions. Thank you.*

Vision:
=======

Babycastles Academy events are weekend afternoon workshops (and sometimes game jams or talks) on topics related to artist-focused game development, world-building and the intersection of art and technology. Workshops can be experienced individually or as a series to learn a broad range of skills and techniques. Our audience is a broad community of creative practitioners from visual artists, musicians, sculptors, programmers, dancers, performers, poets, writers and those who may not self-identity as having any particular relevant skills but are interested in learning.

Rather than the approach of professional game production companies, our focus is game design as an artist creation process akin to the handcrafted process of building zines, paintings, art films and theater. We see game creation as a medium synthesizing visual design, sound, sculpture, programming and performance. Never one to be boxed in by hard definitions, our workshops include topics, skills and techniques that go beyond strictly games. Past workshops include skills in setting goals, workshops in Python, and more. Traditional game-design workshops or classes diverge greatly from this approach, and are pricey, inaccessible to the diverse community we aim to serve.

While we’ve found success as an artist-run space dedicated to games, we’ve always been proud to be representative of a broader community that is not always represented by the Game Industry. Our workshops aim to serve this broad community of individuals of many intersectional identities across gender, race, class, age, ability.

Information
===========

**When**? Sundays at 3pm!

**Where?** [*twitch.tv/babycastles*](https://www.twitch.tv/babycastles)

**How long**? 1 to 2 hours.

**What**? Teach a skill! Something that would have an audience at Babycastles. Doesn’t need to be game-related. Examples include: I*ntro to Making a Flatgame, How to Set Personal Goals, Pixel Scene Design, a tutorial on Unity’s new input system*. A playlist of past videos of workshops can be found [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_9su_zqESg&list=PLJzpMnmDTJIUBNOpzI5qdPJ1cXhITBSq-).

We use Twitch, which makes for a more casual level of engagement with participants than Zoom for example. But if you have other ideas you’d like to try to implement, chat with us and we’ll work something out.

*Alternatively: Lead a jam. Usually you give an introduction, show off a tool and/or concept, then leave time for folks to work on the project and share their results at the end. OR give a talk on an area of research.*

**Who?** Anyone interested in teaching something that would be a good fit for the Babycastles community can participate. If you need help developing your idea or structuring it, we are happy to provide feedback or support.

**\$?** We are happy to give you 70% of the workshop signup income.
